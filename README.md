# Library Management System

## Overview

This is a fullstack library management web application built with Next.js, PostgreSQL, Prisma, and React. The system provides a comprehensive interface with authentication and role-based access for different user types (User, Librarian, Admin).

**Features Implemented**:

- üîê **Authentication System**: Login functionality with JWT tokens
- üìö **Books Management**: Browse all available books in the library
- üé® **Modern UI**: Built with Radix UI themes and Tailwind CSS
- üîÑ **Dynamic Navigation**: Navigation bar that changes based on user authentication state

## Demo Accounts

The application includes these demo accounts for testing:

| Role      | Email                 | Password    |
| --------- | --------------------- | ----------- |
| User      | user@library.com      | password123 |
| Librarian | librarian@library.com | password123 |
| Admin     | admin@library.com     | password123 |

## Schema Enhancements

The database schema has been enhanced to provide a more comprehensive library management experience. New features include:

- **Enhanced User Profiles** with membership status, contact information, and more
- **Book Management** with detailed information, multiple formats, and condition tracking
- **Genre System** with a dedicated model and many-to-many relationship with books
- **Review System** allowing users to rate and comment on books
- **Reservation System** for requesting books that are currently checked out
- **Fine Management** for tracking and processing late fees and damages
- **Notification System** for due dates, reservations, and other library communications

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- PostgreSQL database

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up the database:
   ```
   # Configure your PostgreSQL connection in .env
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/library_management"
   ```
4. Run migrations:
   ```
   npx prisma migrate dev --schema=src/prisma/schema.prisma
   ```
5. Seed the database:
   ```
   npm run seed
   ```
6. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### Quick Start

Use the provided `start.sh` script to automatically:

```
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

## Applying Schema Enhancements

To apply the enhanced database schema and updated API endpoints:

1. Make sure your PostgreSQL database is running
2. Run the enhancement script:
   ```
   chmod +x apply_schema_enhancements.sh
   ./apply_schema_enhancements.sh
   ```
3. Restart your application
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
